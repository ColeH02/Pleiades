## Inspiration
We were inspired by the notion that correlation does not imply causation, and we set out to test the truth behind this statement. After spending 2 of our 1 hour brainstorming budget throwing ideas at each other, we decided on combining star alignment with machine learning. The outcome? This application. Pleiades. Named after The Seven Sisters star system, part of the constellation Taurus. In this day and age, many people face the problem of finding a true, deep connection with others. What could be deeper than the connection we have with the Universe?

## What it does
This is a dating application. There are many like it, but this one is ours, and it contains several key differences. Our dating app utilizes dark maths and powerful star tracking to calculate everyone's unique Astral Love Quotient. Separate from other dating apps that rely on decades old static data, ours stays up-to-date by constantly recalculating based on the movement of the Pleiades star cluster. In addition, our highly classified ALQ algorithm takes into account various cosmic factors such as the frequency of the universe to ensure that any factor that affects your love life is accounted for. 

## Whats next?
Pleiades is a wonderful concept, although it has its flaws. The GSS dataset, while super cool, is probably not the best for determining someone's love life, and we did not have ample time to vet it properly. Also our application lacks many features we had planned but couldn't achieve, such as a proper database for ~real~ users and not just accounts we created ourselves.
